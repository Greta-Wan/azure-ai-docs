# Agentic retrieval in Azure AI Search

[!INCLUDE [Feature preview](./includes/previews/preview-generic.md)]

In Azure AI Search, *agentic retrieval* is a new parallel query processing architecture that generates multiple subqueries from a single retrieval request, producing high quality grounding data for chat and generative AI solutions. 

Programmatically, agentic retrieval is supported through a new Agents object in the newest preview data plane REST API, 2025-05-01-preview. An agent's retrieval response is designed for downstream consumption by other agents and chat apps based on generative AI.

## Why use agentic retrieval

You should use agentic retrieval when you want to customize a chat experience with high quality inputs that include your proprietary data. The grounding data is derived from indexed documents (plain text and vectors) in Azure AI Search. The custom experience is powered by a new retrieval pipeline in AI Search that adds query expansion powered by a conversational language model for query planning and execution. It's intended for integration into custom chat solutions, particular those patterned after an agent-to-agent approach.

The *agentic* aspect is a reasoning step in query planning processing that's performed by a large language model (LLM). The LLM is tasked with designing multiple subqueries based on the inputs and parameters you provide. All queries execute in parallel. Metadata about query execution is included in the response.

Agentic retrieval adds latency to query processing, but it adds these capabilities:

+ Reads the existing chat history as an input to the retrieval pipeline.
+ Rewrites an original query into multiple subqueries using both synonym maps (optional) *and* LLM-generated paraphrasing.
+ Corrects spelling mistakes.
+ Deconstructs a complex query, such as hybrid query with filters, into component parts.
+ Executes all subqueries in parallel.
+ Outputs a unified result as a single string. Alternatively, you can extract parts of the response for your solution.

Agentic retrieval invokes the entire query processing pipeline multiple times for each query request, but it does so in parallel, preserving the efficiency and performance necessary for a satisfactory user experience.

> [!NOTE]
> Including an LLM in query planning adds latency to a query pipeline. You can mitigate by using faster models such as gpt-4o-mini and summarizing the message threads, but you should expect longer query times with this pipeline.

## Agentic retrieval architecture

Agentic retrieval is designed for a conversational search experience that includes an LLM. An important part of agentic retrieval is that an entire chat conversation can be included as inputs in subsequent queries, providing context and nuance for more relevant responses.

<!-- Insert architecture diagram here -->
Agentic retrieval has these components:

+ An index on Azure AI Search containing plain text and vector content.
+ An LLM that you deploy in Azure OpenAI used for query planning.
+ An agent on Azure AI Search that connects to your model, providing parameters and inputs to build a query plan.
+ A retrieval engine in Azure AI Search that executes on the LLM query plan and other parameters, returning a rich response that includes content and query plan metadata.

<!-- Insert multiquery pipeline diagram here -->
Agentic retrieval has these processes:

+ Request for agentic retrieval is initiated when your app passes in a query and conversation history to an agent.
+ Agent connects to an LLM for a query planning step, converting chat history into multiple subqueries.
+ All subqueries execute simultaneously on Azure AI Search and generate structured results and extracted references.
+ Results are merged.
+ Response is formulated and returned as a three part response consisting of a unified result, a reference array, and an activities array that enumerates all operations.

## Availability and pricing

Agentic retrieval is available in these regions, on all tiers including the free tier:

+ **East US**
+ **North Europe**
+ **Japan East**
+ **Sweden Central**

Agentic retrieval billing will have two parts:

+ Billing for query planning is pay-as-you-go in Azure OpenAI. It's token based for both input and output tokens. The model you assign to the agent is the one charged for token usage. For example, if you use gpt-4o, the token charge appears in the bill for gpt-4o.

+ Billing for semantic ranking during query execution. This billing will be token based and is pay-as-you-go on the Azure AI Search side through the semantic ranker. Semantic ranker, which is a premium billable feature, is an integral part of agentic retrieval. You're charged on the Azure AI Search side for token inputs to the semantic ranking models. 

Billing for semantic ranking during query execution will be implemented *after* the initial phase of the public preview. Semantic ranking is performed for every subquery in the plan. Semantic ranking charges are based on the number of tokens returned by each subquery.

  | Aspect | Classic single-query pipeline | Agentic retrieval multi-query pipeline |
  |--------|------------------------|----------------------------|
  | Unit | Query-based (1,000 queries) per unit of currency| Token-based (1 million tokens per unit of currency) |
  | Cost per unit | Uniform cost per query | Uniform cost per token |
  | Cost estimation | Estimate query count | Estimate token usage |
  | Free tier| 1,000 free queries | 50 million free tokens |

> [!NOTE]
> Existing semantic ranker billing is unchanged if you're using it outside of agentic retrieval. For pricing without agentic retrieval, see the [Azure AI Search pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/).

### Example: Estimate costs

There are two billing models in effect for agentic retrieval. Billing from Azure AI Search for semantic ranking (query execution) and billing from Azure OpenAI (query planning).

The prices shown in this article are hypothetical. They're used to illustrate the estimation process. Your costs could be lower. For the actual price of transactions, see [Azure OpenAI pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/openai-service/#pricing). For query execution, there's no charge for semantic ranking for agentic retrieval in the initial public preview.

#### Estimated billing costs for query planning

To estimate the query plan costs as pay-as-you-go in Azure OpenAI, let's assume gpt-4o-mini:

+ 15 cents for 1 million input tokens
+ 60 cents for 1 million output tokens
+ Assume small chat conversations of 2,000 input tokens
+ Assume an average output plan size of 350 tokens

#### Estimated billing costs for query execution

To estimate the semantic ranking costs associated with agentic retrieval, start with an idea of what an average document in your index looks like. For example, you might approximate:

+ 10,000 chunks, where each chunk is one to two paragraphs of a PDF.
+ 500 tokens per chunk.
+ Each subquery reranks up to 50 chunks.
+ On average, there are three subqueries per query plan.

#### Calculating price of execution

1. Assume we make 2,000 agentic retrievals with three subqueries per plan. This gives us about 6,000 total queries.

1. Rerank 50 chunks per subquery, which is 300,000 total chunks.

1. Average chunk is 500 tokens, so total tokens for reranking is 150 million.

1. Given a hypothetical price of 0.022 per token, $3.30 is the total cost for reranking in US dollars.

1. Moving on to query plan costs: 2,000 input tokens multiplied by 2,000 agentic retrievals equals 4 million input tokens for a total of 60 cents.

1. Estimate output costs based on an average of 350 tokens. If we multiply 350 by 2,000 agentic retrievals, we get 700,000 output tokens total for a total of 42 cents.

Putting it all together, you'd pay about $3.30 for the semantic ranking in Azure AI Search, 60 cents for input tokens in Azure OpenAI, and 42 cents for output tokens in Azure OpenAI, for $1.02 for query planning total. Combined cost for the full execution is $4.02.
