Learn how to use the *Azure.Search.Documents* client library to create, load, and query a search index using sample data for [full text search](../../search-lucene-query-architecture.md). Full text search uses Apache Lucene for indexing and queries, and a BM25 ranking algorithm for scoring results.

This quickstart creates and queries a small hotels-quickstart index containing data about four hotels.
