In this quickstart, you use the Azure.Search.Documents client library to create, load, and query a search index with sample data for [full-text search](../../search-lucene-query-architecture.md). Full-text search uses Apache Lucene for indexing and queries and the BM25 ranking algorithm for scoring results.

This quickstart creates and queries a small `hotels-quickstart` index containing data about four hotels.
