# Quickstart: Get answers in the chat playground

Learn how to get answers using the chat playground in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs). This quickstart shows you how to deploy chat models and get AI-powered responses to your questions quickly and easily in the Azure AI Foundry portal.

For this quickstart, you can use either a [!INCLUDE [hub](../includes/hub-project-name.md)] or a [!INCLUDE [fdp](../includes/fdp-project-name.md)]. For more information about the differences between these two project types, see [Project types](../what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md#project-types).

## Get answers in the playground

Use the [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com/?cid=learnDocs) playground to get answers from AI models. In this quickstart, you'll learn how to ask questions and get responses from deployed chat models.

To get answers from your deployed model in the chat playground, follow these steps:

1. In the **System message** text box, provide this prompt to guide the assistant: "You're an AI assistant that helps people find information." You can tailor the prompt for your scenario.
1. Optionally, add a safety system message by selecting the **Add section** button, then **Safety system messages**. Choose from the prebuilt messages, and then edit them to your needs.

1. Select **Apply changes** to save your changes, and when prompted to see if you want to update the system message, select **Continue**. 
1. In the chat session pane, enter the following question: "How much do the TrailWalker hiking shoes cost?"
1. Select the right arrow icon to send.

1. The assistant either replies that it doesn't know the answer or provides a generic response. For example, the assistant might say, "The price of TrailWalker hiking shoes can vary depending on the brand, model, and where you purchase them." The model doesn't have access to current product information about the TrailWalker hiking shoes. 

Next, you can add your data to the model to help it answer questions about your products. Try the [Deploy an enterprise chat web app](../tutorials/deploy-chat-web-app.md) tutorial to learn more.
