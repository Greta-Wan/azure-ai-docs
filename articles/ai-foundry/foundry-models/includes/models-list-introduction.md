Depending on what [kind of project](../../what-is-azure-ai-foundry.md#work-in-an-azure-ai-foundry-project) you're using in Azure AI Foundry, you might see a different selection of these models. Specifically, if you're using a Foundry project, built on an Azure AI Foundry resource, you see the models that are available for standard deployment to a Foundry resource. Alternatively, if you're using a hub-based project, hosted by an Azure AI Foundry hub, you see models that are available for deployment to managed compute and serverless APIs. These model selections do overlap in many cases, since many models support the multiple [deployment options](../../concepts/deployments-overview.md).
