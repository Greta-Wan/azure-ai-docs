# Responsible AI FAQ for @Foundry

## What is @Foundry in Azure AI Foundry?

@Foundry is an AI agent that enabled users of Azure AI Foundry to navigate its capabilities, identify models, and resources to build generative AI applications. For an overview of how @Foundry works and a summary of its capabilities, see [@Foundry overview](./ask-at-foundry.md).

## What is the current status of @Foundry?

@Foundry is available in Azure AI Foundry as a preview feature.

## Are @Foundry's results reliable?

@Foundry is designed to generate the best possible responses with the context to which it has access. However, like any AI system, @Foundry's responses are not always perfect. All of @Foundry's responses should be carefully tested, reviewed, and vetted before making changes to your Azure environment.

## What data does @Foundry collect?

User-provided prompts and @Foundry's responses are not used to further train, retrain, or improve Azure OpenAI Service foundation models that generate responses. User-provided prompts and @Foundry's responses are collected and used to improve Microsoft products and services only when users give explicit consent to include this information [within feedback](#how-do-i-provide-feedback-on-foundry). We collect user engagement data, such as the number of chat sessions and session duration, the skill that's used in a particular session, thumbs up, thumbs down, feedback, etc. This information is retained and used as set forth in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).

## How do I provide feedback on @Foundry?

If you see a response that is inaccurate, or not supporting your needs use the thumbs-down buttons below the response to submit feedback. You can also submit feedback on your overall experience by using the usual Azure AI Foundry feedback button on the top menu.

## What should I do if I see unexpected or offensive content?

The Azure AI Foundry team has built @Foundry guided by our [AI principles](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/principles-and-approach) and [Responsible AI Standard](https://aka.ms/RAIStandardPDF). We have prioritized mitigating exposing customers to offensive content. However, you might still see unexpected results. We're constantly working to improve our technology in preventing harmful content.

If you encounter harmful or inappropriate content in the system provide feedback or report a concern by selecting the downvote button on the response.

## How current is the information @Foundry provides?

We update @Foundry daily to ensure it provides the latest information to you. In most cases, the information @Foundry provides is up to date. However, there might be some delay between new Azure AI Foundry announcements to the time @Foundry is updated.
