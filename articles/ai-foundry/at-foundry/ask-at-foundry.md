# Ask @Foundry for help (preview)

## Overview

The @Foundry agent is here to assist you with questions about Azure AI Foundry. To start using @Foundry, simply click on the @Foundry icon located in the top left bar of the interface. A chat window opens where you can type your questions and receive answers in real-time.


## Capabilities

**What @Foundry Can Do** - The agent is designed to provide assistance by answering questions based on:

- **Azure AI Foundry Documentation**: It can help you navigate and understand the documentation.
- **Model Catalog**: It can provide information about the models available in the Azure AI Foundry catalog.

**What @Foundry Cannot Do** - While @Foundry is a powerful tool, it has some limitations:

- **No Access to Your Resources**: @Foundry can't access your Azure resources. For example, it can't answer questions like "How much capacity do I have?" or "What is the status of my deployment?"
- **Limited Scope**: It's restricted to answering questions related to the Azure AI Foundry documentation and model catalog. It can't provide support for unrelated Azure services or external systems.

Use @Foundry to make the most of the Azure AI Foundry experience, but keep its scope and limitations in mind when asking questions.
