To create a [!INCLUDE [fdp-project-name](fdp-project-name.md)] in [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com), follow these steps:

1. Go to [Azure AI Foundry](https://ai.azure.com). If you are in a project, select **Azure AI Foundry** at the top left of the page to go to the **Home** page.
1. Select **Start building**.
1. Enter a name for the project.
1. Select **Create**.  Or, if you want to customize your settings, follow the steps in the next section.

### Advanced options

A [!INCLUDE [fdp-project-name](fdp-project-name.md)] is created on an `AIServices` resource. This resource is created for you automatically when you create the project. 

To customize the settings for your project, follow these steps:

1. In the **Create a project** form, select **Advanced options**.

1. Select an existing **Resource group** you want to use, or leave the default to create a new resource group.

    > [!TIP]
    > Especially for getting started we recommend you create a new resource group for your project. The resource group allows you to easily manage the project and all of its resources together. 

1. Select a **Location** or use the default. The location is the region where the hub is hosted. Azure AI services availability differs per region. For example, certain models might not be available in certain regions.

1. Select **Create**. You see progress of resource creation and the project is created when the process is complete.
