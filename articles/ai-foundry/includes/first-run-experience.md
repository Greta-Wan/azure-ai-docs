Use this fast path when you don't have any projects yet. Pick what you want to do and we create the project and get you into the right playground. It is suggested to start with

To start with an agent, use the following steps:

1. In the top breadcrumb, select **Azure AI Foundry**, then select **Create an agent**.

1. Enter a project name. Confirm your directory and subscription. Select **Create**.
