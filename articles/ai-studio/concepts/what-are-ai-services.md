# What are AI services?

[Azure AI Foundry](../what-is-ai-studio.md) is a comprehensive platform for AI development that provides a wide range of tools and services to help you build AI solutions. You can explore the [model catalog](../how-to/model-catalog-overview.md) to find the right model for your use case. 

[Azure AI services](../../ai-services/what-are-ai-services.md) are a collection of task and general purpose models in Azure AI Foundry. These services are designed to help you build AI solutions quickly and easily, without needing to build and train your own models from scratch. In some cases, you can customize these models to better fit your specific needs. 

> [!TIP]
> While some articles from each service are available in the [Azure AI Foundry documentation](../ai-services/how-to/connect-ai-services.md), explore each service in more depth in their individual service documentation.
