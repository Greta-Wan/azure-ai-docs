# What is Foundry Local?

Foundry Local is a local version of Azure AI Foundry that runs large language models (LLMs) directly on your device. This on-device AI inference solution offers privacy, customization, and cost advantages over cloud-based options. It integrates seamlessly into your existing workflows and applications through an intuitive CLI and REST API.

By leveraging the optimization capabilities of ONNX Runtime, Olive, and the ONNX ecosystem, Foundry Local delivers a highly optimized and responsive experience for running AI models locally.

## Key features

- **On-Device Inference**: Run LLMs locally on your own hardware, reducing cloud dependency while keeping all your data on your device.

- **Model Customization**: Select from preset models or use your own to meet specific requirements and use cases.

- **Cost Efficiency**: Eliminate recurring cloud service costs by using your existing hardware, making AI more accessible.

- **Seamless Integration**: Connect with your applications through API endpoints or the CLI, with easy scaling to Azure AI Foundry as your needs grow.

## Use cases

Foundry Local is ideal for scenarios where:

- Data privacy and security are paramount
- You need to operate in environments with limited or no internet connectivity
- You want to reduce cloud inference costs
- You need low-latency AI responses for real-time applications
- You want to experiment with AI models before deploying to a cloud environment

## Pricing and billing

Entirely Free! You're using your own hardware, and there are no extra costs associated with running AI models locally.

## How to get access
