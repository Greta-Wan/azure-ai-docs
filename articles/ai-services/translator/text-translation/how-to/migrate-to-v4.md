# Azure AI Translator 2025-05-01-preview migration

Azure AI Translator text translation 2025-05-01-preview (v4.0) is our latest cloud-based, multilingual neural machine translation service. As Azure AI Translator matures, we're focused on patterns and practices to best support and add value to our users.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> * Azure AI Translator REST API `2025-05-01-preview` is new version of the Azure AI Translator REST API **with breaking changes**.
> * It's essential to thoroughly test your code against the new release before migrating any production applications from Azure AI Translator v3.0.
> * Make sure to review your code and internal workflows for adherence to best practices and restrict your production code to versions that you fully test.


The latest version of Azure AI Translator includes the following enhancements and capabilities:

 * **Large language model (LLM) choice**. You can choose a large language model based for translation based on quality, cost, and other factors, while avoiding costs associated with prompt engineering and quality evaluations.

* **Adaptive custom translation**. New features enable adaptive custom translations using datasets or reference pairs to ensure more accurate and contextually relevant translations.

* **Expanded translation parameters**. The API supports a range of parameters, including text type, language codes, and options for tone and gender, providing more nuanced translation outputs.
