# Translator v3.0

Azure AI Translator v3.0 is a cloud-based, multilingual, neural machine translation service that provides robust and scalable translation capabilities suitable for diverse applications. Translator service supports over 100 languages and dialects, making it ideal for businesses, developers, and organizations seeking to seamlessly integrate multilingual communication. Translator is an optimal solution for managing extensive multilingual content and easily integrates with your applications and workflows through a single REST API call and supports multiple programming languages. Azure AI Translator prioritizes data security and privacy, complying with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and ISO/SOC, thus ensuring that it's a reliable solution for handling sensitive and confidential information.

## What's new?

* **Transliteration**. Convert text in one language from one script to another script.

* **Complex translation**. Translate multiple languages in a single request.

* **Multiple operations**. Utilize language detection, translation, and transliteration in one request.

* **Dictionary lookup**. Add a dictionary to provide alternative translations for a term, find back-translations, and view examples showing terms used in context.

* **Enhanced language detection**. Obtain detailed and comprehensive results for language detection.

## Base URLs

Requests to Translator are, in most cases, handled by the datacenter that is closest to where the request originated. If there's a datacenter failure when using the global endpoint, the request may be routed outside of the geography.

To force the request to be handled within a specific geography, use the desired geographical endpoint. All requests are processed among the datacenters within the geography.

✔️ Feature: **Translator Text** </br>

| Service endpoint | Request processing data center |
|------------------|--------------------------|
|**Global (recommended):**</br>**`api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com`**|Closest available data center.|
|**Americas:**</br>**`api-nam.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com`**|East US 2 &bull; West US 2|
|**Asia Pacific:**</br>**`api-apc.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com`**|Japan East &bull; Southeast Asia|
|**Europe (except Switzerland):**</br>**`api-eur.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com`**|France Central &bull; West Europe|
|**Switzerland:**</br> For more information, *see* [Switzerland service endpoints](#switzerland-service-endpoints).|Switzerland North &bull; Switzerland West|

#### Switzerland service endpoints

Customers with a resource located in Switzerland North or Switzerland West can ensure that their Text API requests are served within Switzerland. To ensure that requests are handled in Switzerland, create the Translator resource in the `Resource region` `Switzerland North` or `Switzerland West`, then use the resource's custom endpoint in your API requests.

For example: If you create a Translator resource in Azure portal with `Resource region` as `Switzerland North` and your resource name is `my-swiss-n`, then your custom endpoint is `https&#8203;://my-swiss-n.cognitiveservices.azure.com`. And a sample request to translate is:

 ```bash
// Pass secret key and region using headers to a custom endpoint
curl -X POST "https://my-swiss-n.cognitiveservices.azure.com/translator/text/v3.0/translate?to=fr" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: xxx" \
-H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region: switzerlandnorth" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d "[{'Text':'Hello'}]" -v
```

Custom Translator isn't currently available in Switzerland.



### **Headers**

|Header|Value|
|:-----|:----|
|Authorization| The value is an access **bearer token** generated by Microsoft Entra ID.</br><ul><li> The bearer token provides proof of authentication and validates the client's authorization to use the resource.</li><li> An authentication token is valid for 10 minutes and should be reused when making multiple calls to Translator.</br></li>*See* [Sample request: 2. Get a token](../../../../authentication.md?tabs=powershell#sample-request)</ul>|
|Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region| The value is the region of the **translator resource**.</br><ul><li> This value is optional if the resource is global.</li></ul>|
|Ocp-Apim-ResourceId| The value is the Resource ID for your Translator resource instance.</br><ul><li>You find the Resource ID in the Azure portal at **Translator Resource  → Properties**. </li><li>Resource ID format: </br>/subscriptions/<**subscriptionId**>/resourceGroups/<**resourceGroupName**>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<**resourceName**>/</li></ul>|

##### **Translator property page—Azure portal**

:::image type="content" source="../../../media/managed-identities/resource-id-property.png" alt-text="Screenshot:Translator properties page in the Azure portal. ":::

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Assign [**Cognitive Services User**](/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles/ai-machine-learning#cognitive-services-user) role to the service principal. By assigning this role, you're granting service principal access to the Translator resource.

### **Examples**

#### **Using the global endpoint**

 ```bash
 // Using headers, pass a bearer token generated by Azure AD, resource ID, and the region.

curl -X POST "https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/translate?api-version=3.0&to=es" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <Base64-access_token>"\
     -H "Ocp-Apim-ResourceId: <Resource ID>" \
     -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region: <your-region>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -data-raw "[{'Text':'Hello, friend.'}]"
```

#### **Using your custom endpoint**

 ```bash
// Using headers, pass a bearer token generated by Azure AD.

curl -X POST https://<your-custom-domain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/translator/text/v3.0/translate?api-version=3.0&to=es \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <Base64-access_token>"\
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -data-raw "[{'Text':'Hello, friend.'}]"
```

### **Examples using managed identities**

Translator v3.0 also supports authorizing access to managed identities. If a managed identity is enabled for a translator resource, you can pass the bearer token generated by managed identity in the request header.

#### **With the global endpoint**

 ```bash
// Using headers, pass a bearer token generated either by Azure AD or Managed Identities, resource ID, and the region.

curl -X POST https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/translate?api-version=3.0&to=es \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <Base64-access_token>"\
     -H "Ocp-Apim-ResourceId: <Resource ID>" \
     -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region: <your-region>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -data-raw "[{'Text':'Hello, friend.'}]"
```

#### **With your custom endpoint**

 ```bash
//Using headers, pass a bearer token generated by Managed Identities.

curl -X POST https://<your-custom-domain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/translator/text/v3.0/translate?api-version=3.0&to=es \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <Base64-access_token>"\
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -data-raw "[{'Text':'Hello, friend.'}]"
```

## Virtual Network support

The Translator service is now available with Virtual Network (`VNET`) capabilities in all regions of the Azure public cloud. To enable Virtual Network, *See* [Configuring Azure AI services virtual networks](../../../../cognitive-services-virtual-networks.md?tabs=portal).

Once you turn on this capability, you must use the custom endpoint to call the Translator. You can't use the global translator endpoint ("api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com") and you can't authenticate with an access token.

You can find the custom endpoint after you create a [translator resource](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesTextTranslation) and allow access from selected networks and private endpoints.

1. Navigate to your Translator resource in the Azure portal.
1. Select **Networking** from the **Resource Management** section.
1. Under the **Firewalls and virtual networks** tab, choose **Selected Networks and Private Endpoints**.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../media/virtual-network-setting-azure-portal.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the virtual network setting in the Azure portal.":::

1. Select **Save** to apply your changes.
1. Select **Keys and Endpoint** from the **Resource Management** section.
1. Select the **Virtual Network** tab.
1. Listed there are the endpoints for Text Translation and Document Translation.

   :::image type="content" source="../../../media/virtual-network-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the virtual network endpoint.":::

|Headers|Description|
|:-----|:----|
|Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key| The value is the Azure secret key for your subscription to Translator.|
|Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region| The value is the region of the translator resource. This value is optional if the resource is `global`|

Here's an example request to call the Translator using the custom endpoint

 ```bash
// Pass secret key and region using headers
curl -X POST "https://<your-custom-domain>.cognitiveservices.azure.com/translator/text/v3.0/translate?api-version=3.0&to=es" \
     -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key:<your-key>" \
     -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Region:<your-region>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "[{'Text':'Hello, what is your name?'}]"
```
