# Prompt shields content filtering

Prompt shields are a feature of the Azure OpenAI content filtering system that helps detect and mitigate user prompt attacks. These attacks occur when a user attempts to manipulate the model's behavior by embedding harmful or inappropriate content within their input.

Prompt shields analyzes LLM inputs and detects adversarial user input attacks.
