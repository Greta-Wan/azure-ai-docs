# Understanding Document Intelligence Layout API Markdown Output Format

Azure AI Document Intelligence's Layout API can transform your documents into rich markdown, preserving their original structure and formatting. Simply specify outputContentFormat=markdown in your request to receive semantically structured content that maintains paragraphs, headings, tables, and other document elements in their proper hierarchy.

This markdown output elegantly captures the document's original organization while providing standardized, easily consumable content for downstream applications. The preserved semantic structure enables more sophisticated document processing workflows without losing the context and relationships between document elements.


## Markdown elements supported in Layout Analysis

Document Intelligence returns the following Markdown elements as part of the analysis response:

* Paragraph
* Heading
* Table
* Figure
* Selection Mark
* Formula
* Barcode
* PageNumber/PageHeader/PageFooter
* PageBreak
* KeyValuePairs/Language/Style
* Spans and Content

### Paragraph

A paragraph is a grouping of one or more lines of text.

Between paragraphs we have at least one empty line (carriage return).

In one paragraph, we use one line-break between each textlines when generated by OCR.

Here is an example:

``` md
This is paragraph 1.
This is still paragraph 1, even if in another markdown line.

This is paragraph 2. There is a blank line between paragraph 1 and paragraph 2.
```
---

### Heading

We use 1-6 unescaped # and a space to present headings. And 2 blank lines before each heading.

We Output Format each prefix which means # will be rendered "Heading 1", ## for "Heading 2", etc.

Here is an example:

``` md
# This is a title

## This is heading 1

### This is heading 2

#### This is heading 3
```
---


### Table

To present handle more complex tables, we changed table representation to use HTML table from markdown by default.

Following HTML table syntax, we use tag <table> to present table, tab <tr> to present table row, <th> and <td> to present table cell and <caption> to represent table title.

If table has footers, it will presented after the table.

Also, there are 2 blank lines before each table.


Here is an example:

``` md
<table>
<caption>Table 1. This is a demo table</caption>
<tr><th>Header</th><th>Header</th></tr>
<tr><td>Cell</td><td>Cell</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cell</td><td>Cell</td></tr>
<tr><td>Cell</td><td>Cell</td></tr>
<tr><td>Footer</td><td>Footer</td></tr>
</table>

This is the footnote of the table.
```

### Figure

We leverage html tag <figure> to present figure object, the content in figure was present as normal paragraph in <figure> block

If figure have caption, we use tag <figcaption> to present the caption

If figure have footnotes, it was presented as normal paragraph after the figure.

Here is an example:

``` md 
<figure>
<figcaption>Figure 2 This is a figure</figcaption>

Values
300
200
100
0

Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Months

</figure>

This is footnote if the figure have.
```
---

### Selection Mark

We use unicode ☒ and ☐ instead of :selected: and :unselected: to present selected and unselected selection mark

We removed the checkbox extracted from legacy model whose confidence score is 0.1


### Formula

We use $...$ to present inline formula, and $$...$$ to present display formula line

If multiple display formula line was in same formula block, we use $$...$$\n$$...$$ to present

Here is an example of inline formula, single-line formula block and multiple-lines formula block:

``` md
The mass-energy equivalence formula $E = m c ^ { 2 }$ is an example of an inline formula

$$\frac { n ! } { k ! \left( n - k \right) ! } = \binom { n } { k }$$

$$\frac { p _ { j } } { p _ { 1 } } = \prod _ { k = 1 } ^ { j - 1 } e ^ { - \beta _ { k , k + 1 } \Delta E _ { k , k + 1 } }$$
$$= \exp \left[ - \sum _ { k = 1 } ^ { j - 1 } \beta _ { k , k + 1 } \Delta E _ { k , k + 1 } \right] .$$
```
---

### Barcode
We used `![QRCode](barcodes/1.1 "https://www.microsoft.com")` format to present barcode object as an image-like object


The barcode kind will be presented as image description and the barcode value as it's title.


Here is an example:

```
![QrCode:value](./media/barcode/qr.svg)

![BarCode:001](./media/barcode/barcode.svg)

```

### PageNumber/PageHeader/PageFooter

The PageNumber/PageHeader/PageFooter belong to the page but not suitable for document presentation.

We put these into HTML comment to hide them in rendering

Here is an example:

``` md
<!-- PageHeader="This is page header" -->

<!-- PageFooter="This is page footer" -->
<!-- PageNumber="1" -->

```

--

### PageNumber/PageHeader/PageFooter

To easy figure out which parts belong to which page base on the pure Markdown content, we introduced PageBreak as the delimiter of the pages

Here is an example:
``` md
<!-- PageBreak -->
```
---

### KeyValuePairs/Language/Style

For KeyValuePairs/Language/Style, we map them to  Analytics JSON body and not in the Markdown content.
