In this quickstart, you'll use Speech and Language services to recognize intents from audio data captured from a microphone. Specifically, you'll use the Speech service to recognize speech, and a [Conversational Language Understanding (CLU)](../../../../language-service/conversational-language-understanding/overview.md) model to identify intents. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Intent recognition services will be retired on October 1st 2025. The IntentRecognizer API in the Speech SDK will be deprecated shortly after.
