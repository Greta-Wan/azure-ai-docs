> [!IMPORTANT]
> Intent recognition in Azure AI Speech will be retired on September 30th 2025. Your applications won't be able to use intent recognition directly via Azure AI Speech after this date. However, you will still be able to perform intent recognition using Azure AI Language Service or Azure OpenAI.
> 
> This change doesn't affect other Azure AI Speech capabilities such as [speech to text](../speech-to-text.md) (including no change to speaker diarization), [text to speech](../text-to-speech.md), and [speech translation](../speech-translation.md).
