## Base path

Custom Speech API continues to use the query parameterâ€“based versioning scheme introduced in the `2024-11-15` release. There is no change to the base path in this version.
Keep using `/speechtotext` as the base path and update the API version in all requests from `?api-version=2024-11-15` to `?api-version=2025-10-15`.

## Datasets

The `project` property, which was removed in the `2024-11-15` version, is added back to dataset creation and update requests.

## Models

The `project` property, which was removed in the `2024-11-15` version, is added back to model creation and update requests.
 
## Evaluations

The `project` property, which was removed in the `2024-11-15` version, is added back to evaluation creation and update requests.

## Endpoints

The `project` property, which was removed in the `2024-11-15` version, is added back to endpoint creation and update requests.

## Transcriptions

The `project` property, which was removed in the `2024-11-15` version, is added back to transcription creation and update requests.
 
## Projects

The `project` API is added back.

The `foundryProjectName` property is introduced in project creation, update, and list operations:

- Creation: Include `foundryProjectName` to set the AI Foundry project name when creating a new project.

- Update: The `foundryProjectName` can be updated to change the associated AI Foundry project name.

- List: The `foundryProjectName` property can be used as a filter when listing projects.
