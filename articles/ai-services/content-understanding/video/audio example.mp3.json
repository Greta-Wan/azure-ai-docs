2>Like a re, yeah.\n\n00:05.920 --> 00:06.240\n<v Speaker 2>Okay.\n\n00:06.520 --> 00:11.040\n<v Speaker 1>So I never kind of use Snapchat to send any messages.\n\n00:11.120 --> 00:12.520\n<v Speaker 1>I'm always just using it to receive.\n\n00:13.640 --> 00:22.360\n<v Speaker 1>And the reason why I use it more is because people like my brothers in Malaysia, they have new babies.\n\n00:22.400 --> 00:24.800\n<v Speaker 1>So they have a new nephew and a new niece.\n\n00:25.760 --> 00:26.120\n<v Speaker 1>Oh, cool.\n\n00:26.120 --> 00:26.720\n<v Speaker 1>And they would always.\n\n00:27.360 --> 00:34.600\n<v Speaker 1>they would always take videos of the babies on Snapchat, and I can view them whenever I want.\n\n00:35.200 --> 00:47.600\n<v Speaker 1>And the nice thing about Snapchat is that you can, not only can you view them whenever you want, but it also kind of continuously plays the subsequent video that they take.\n\n00:48.000 --> 00:54.080\n<v Speaker 1>So for example, over the course of the day, if they were to take, let's say, 50 different videos.\n\n00:54.560 --> 00:54.800\n<v Speaker 2>Right.\n\n00:55.000 --> 00:59.840\n<v Speaker 1>And if they were to send it via WhatsApp or text message, I'm gonna.\n\n01:00.160 --> 01:00.640\n<v Speaker 2>Have to click, I'm.\n\n01:01.720 --> 01:06.600\n<v Speaker 1>Gonna have to click, you know, 50 videos one by one, play, load, play, load, play, load.\n\n01:07.200 --> 01:07.520\n<v Speaker 2>Right.\n\n01:07.920 --> 01:17.600\n<v Speaker 1>I end up just not going through all of them because it's just pain, you know, whereas Snapchat, I click, it plays continuously from beginning all the way to end.\n\n01:17.760 --> 01:18.200\n<v Speaker 2>Right.\n\n01:20.760 --> 01:24.520\n<v Speaker 2>So they might send 50 videos in a day or in a couple days.\n\n01:25.680 --> 01:26.400\n<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry, say again.\n\n01:26.800 --> 01:29.280\n<v Speaker 2>Is 50 a realistic number of videos they would send?\n\n01:31.680 --> 01:39.680\n<v Speaker 1>It starts out at 50 and as the baby kind of grows, it kind of decreases in frequency.\n\n01:41.280 --> 01:41.400\n<v Speaker 2>I see.\n\n01:41.400 --> 01:42.000\n<v Speaker 2>Wow, that's a lot.\n\n01:44.160 --> 01:45.240\n<v Speaker 1>Yeah, I mean.\n\n01:46.200 --> 01:46.520\n<v Speaker 1>Sometimes.\n\n01:47.680 --> 01:52.080\n<v Speaker 1>Right now, for example, yesterday I got maybe 10 videos.\n\n01:52.720 --> 01:52.840\n<v Speaker 2>Wow.\n\n01:52.840 --> 01:58.720\n<v Speaker 1>Because they are celebrating the one-year-old birthday of Abigail.\n\n01:59.520 --> 02:00.240\n<v Speaker 2>Oh, never mind me.\n\n02:00.880 --> 02:01.520\n<v Speaker 2>Oh, awesome.\n\n02:02.320 --> 02:09.760\n<v Speaker 1>Yeah, so she's turning one-year-old and the family got together and they were just taking videos and there were about 10 different videos.\n\n02:11.280 --> 02:12.080\n<v Speaker 1>So, yeah.\n\n02:12.880 --> 02:13.440\n<v Speaker 2>Cool.\n\n02:14.160 --> 02:15.760\n<v Speaker 1>That's mostly what I use it for.\n\n02:15.760 --> 02:18.080\n<v Speaker 1>I never send anything back.\n\n02:18.080 --> 02:22.240\n<v Speaker 1>It's more to keep track of them than for them to keep track of me.\n\n02:22.880 --> 02:23.920\n<v Speaker 2>Yeah, totally.\n\n02:24.920 --> 02:28.800\n<v Speaker 1>And also, I think it's easier for them as well.\n\n02:28.800 --> 02:32.880\n<v Speaker 1>Like, for example, everyone is interested in how Abigail, the baby, is doing.\n\n02:33.360 --> 02:42.480\n<v Speaker 1>So when they send it via Snapchat, they can just send it to all their friends instead of having to create a group and then\n\n02:43.840 --> 02:45.600\n<v Speaker 1>send it to specific people.\n\n02:46.160 --> 02:46.480\n<v Speaker 2>Right.\n\n02:46.640 --> 02:53.800\n<v Speaker 1>When you send it via Snapchat, anyone who receives it can choose whether or not they want to view it.\n\n02:54.800 --> 02:59.200\n<v Speaker 1>If you don't view it after a day or two, I can't remember, it just goes away.\n\n02:59.760 --> 03:00.400\n<v Speaker 2>I see.\n\n03:00.720 --> 03:05.920\n<v Speaker 2>So you like that, so you don't have like a buildup of stuff, like a big inbox of random stuff you haven't received.\n\n03:05.920 --> 03:07.520\n<v Speaker 1>Exactly, yeah.\n\n03:07.800 --> 03:08.160\n<v Speaker 1>Interesting.\n\n03:09.120 --> 03:14.360\n<v Speaker 1>So I get a lot of random snapchats from friends that I don't really care much about as well.\n\n03:15.120 --> 03:15.440\n<v Speaker 2>I see.\n\n03:15.440 --> 03:18.640\n<v Speaker 1>So I just don't open them and then they just go away.\n\n03:19.760 --> 03:20.040\n<v Speaker 2>Okay.\n\n03:20.560 --> 03:22.960\n<v Speaker 2>Mostly friends from Malaysia or from here too.\n\n03:22.960 --> 03:25.040\n<v Speaker 1>From here too.\n\n03:25.840 --> 03:26.240\n<v Speaker 2>Okay.\n\n03:26.720 --> 03:34.000\n<v Speaker 2>But are there other people, like how many, what's the ratio of like Malaysia to the States or not in the States to the States?\n\n03:35.600 --> 03:39.040\n<v Speaker 1>I think there are more in the States than in Malaysia.\n\n03:39.760 --> 03:39.880\n<v Speaker 2>Okay.\n\n03:39.880 --> 03:42.720\n<v Speaker 1>And there are also some of it.\n\n03:43.960 --> 03:49.640\n<v Speaker 1>And using Snapchat, you can also follow specific panels, if you say.\n\n03:50.640 --> 03:51.360\n<v Speaker 2>Yeah, totally.\n\n03:52.800 --> 03:54.960\n<v Speaker 1>One of the things that I like is the food channel.\n\n03:55.200 --> 03:58.680\n<v Speaker 1>I really like to see what kind of food they make.\n\n03:58.840 --> 04:02.720\n<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes they have really good recipes and things like that.\n\n04:03.560 --> 04:10.720\n<v Speaker 1>So I follow the food channel, so I actually do view the Snapchat videos that the food channel sends out.\n\n04:10.720 --> 04:11.680\n<v Speaker 2>Oh wow, that's really cool.\n\n04:11.760 --> 04:16.240\n<v Speaker 2>So do you ever make that food or do you just, like what do you, or just for fun to watch it?\n\n04:17.760 --> 04:19.000\n<v Speaker 1>I forward it to my wife.\n\n04:19.360 --> 04:23.120\n<v Speaker 1>That's it.\n```",

					"Summary": {
						"type": "string",
						"valueString": "The conversation revolves around the use of Snapchat by Speaker 1, who primarily uses it to receive videos from family in Malaysia, particularly videos of their new nephew and niece. Speaker 1 appreciates Snapchat's feature of continuous video playback, which is more convenient than other messaging apps. They also mention that Snapchat allows them to avoid a cluttered inbox since unviewed content disappears after a while. Additionally, Speaker 1 follows a food channel on Snapchat and enjoys sharing interesting recipes with their wife. The conversation also touches on the geographical distribution of Speaker 1's contacts, with more friends in the States than in Malaysia."
