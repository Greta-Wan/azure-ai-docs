# Creating a Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Solution with Content Understanding

# Introduction
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding its responses with external knowledge sources, ensuring accuracy and relevance. A key challenge in RAG is effectively extracting and preparing multimodal content – documents, images, audio, and video – so that it can be accurately retrieved and used to inform the LLM's responses. 

The decision about which service to use for extracting multimodal content is critical because it determines the inputs to the LLM. The service should provide:

* **Advanced content extraction capabilities:** Excel at processing diverse content types including documents, images, audio, and video and utilizing modality-aware techniques to maintain crucial contextual relationships within different content formats, ensuring optimal performance in RAG applications. 

* **Enhanced accuracy:** Precision in content extraction directly impacts RAG performance. The ideal service employs advanced techniques like computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, and multimodal understanding to ensure the highest possible accuracy in information extraction across all supported modalities.
* **Simplified and unified workflows for processing diverse content:** Enterprise content ecosystems are heterogeneous, requiring a service that normalizes processing across content types. A unified approach eliminates the complexity of maintaining separate pipelines for different modalities, reducing development overhead and operational complexity.
* **Confidence scoring and source grounding mechanisms:** Extracted information must be verifiable and traceable for enterprise applications. Source grounding—the ability to map extracted information back to its original location in the content—builds trust and enables validation. Confidence scores allow systems to make intelligent decisions about when to use extracted information versus when to request human verification.

Azure AI Content Understanding offers a comprehensive solution for multimodal content extraction that preserves semantic integrity and contextual relationships across diverse content types. By integrating advanced natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition within a unified framework, it eliminates the complexity of managing separate extraction pipelines while ensuring high-quality data processing for documents, images, audio, and video. This approach enables more accurate and comprehensive information retrieval for RAG applications, where context and relationships directly impact response quality and relevance.

## Overcoming Multimodal Content Chunking Challenges with Content Understanding

Chunking is a crucial step in the process of RAG with multimodal content. It involves breaking down large pieces of content into smaller, manageable chunks that can be effectively processed, indexed, and retrieved.  However, multimodal data presents unique challenges:

*   **Documents:** Preserving layout and semantic coherence is essential to avoid disrupting context and meaning.
*   **Images:** Visual elements must be interpreted and verbalized accurately, maintaining relationships between components.
*   **Audio:** Speaker diarization and temporal coherence are necessary to avoid mixing contributions and disrupting narrative flow.
*   **Video:** Scene boundaries and multimodal synchronization must be preserved to maintain context.

Semantic chunking addresses these challenges by focusing on the meaning and relationships within the content, rather than simply splitting it into arbitrary segments. This approach is particularly important for RAG because it ensures that the retrieved chunks contain enough context to be relevant to the user's query, leading to more accurate and coherent generated responses.

Azure AI Content Understanding is meticulously designed to support multimodal RAG use cases, offering robust capabilities for processing and understanding diverse content types. Content Understanding extracts content from documents, images, audio, and video in a manner that preserves contextual and semantic relationships. This approach enables users to deduce meaningful chunks that are highly relevant to the user's query, leading to more accurate and coherent generated responses. By supporting Markdown output for diverse content types, Content Understanding streamlines integration and optimizes downstream RAG operations, making it particularly valuable for enterprise applications requiring deep content understanding and analysis.


## Building a Unified Knowledge Base from Multimodal Content using Content Understanding

### Scenario

Let's consider a scenario where we have a collection of documents, images, videos, and audio files related to a specific topic (e.g., a corporate training program). We want to create a system that can retrieve relevant information from these multimodal sources based on user queries. 

### Implementation

To implement this scenario, you can use Azure AI Content Understanding to automate content extraction, Azure AI Search for indexing and retrieval, and Azure OpenAI chat models for chat completion. Here's a high-level overview of the implementation steps:

### 1. Content Extraction: Transforming Multimodal Content

Content Understanding delivers sophisticated extraction capabilities across all content modalities. In this scenario, the training content data can be processed with modality-specific approaches while maintaining contextual relationships:

- **Document Processing**: Extracts hierarchical structures, preserving the logical organization of training materials including headers, paragraphs, tables, page elements etc.

- **Image Processing**: Transforms visual information into searchable text by verbalizing diagrams and charts, extracting embedded text elements, and converting graphical data into structured formats. Technical illustrations are analyzed to identify components and their relationships.

- **Video Processing**: Segments video content into meaningful units through scene detection and key frame extraction, while generating descriptive summaries, transcribing spoken content, and identifying key topics and sentiment indicators throughout the footage.

- **Audio Processing**: Creates rich textual representations of spoken content with speaker diarization technology, topic segmentation, and automated summaries that capture the essence of discussions, presentations, and Q&A sessions.

This comprehensive extraction creates a rich knowledge base where each content type maintains its unique contextual elements while enabling cross-modal relationships.


The image below illustrates Content Understanding's ability to extract structural elements from a document using layout analysis, showcasing its capability to provide extracted data with regions of interest and their inter-relationships.

The image below exemplifies how data can be meticulously extracted from audio files. In this scenario, content extraction captures audio transcription with speaker role detection, while field extraction generates topics discussed. This output facilitates efficient organization, indexing, and searching of content.

### 2. Create a Unified Search Index

The diverse outputs from Content Understanding's extraction process can be integrated into a unified [Azure AI Search index](https://docs.azure.cn/en-us/search/tutorial-rag-build-solution-index-schema), creating a comprehensive knowledge repository that spans all modalities. This consolidated index enables cross-modal search capabilities, allowing users to discover relevant information regardless of the original content format:

```json

index_name = "unified_training_index"
fields = [
    # Document content fields
    {"name": "document_content", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "retrievable": true},
    {"name": "document_headers", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "retrievable": true},
    
    # Image-derived content
    {"name": "visual_descriptions", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "retrievable": true},    

    # Video content components
    {"name": "video_transcript", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "retrievable": true},
    {"name": "scene_descriptions", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "retrievable": true},
    {"name": "video_topics", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "retrievable": true},
    
    # Audio processing results
    {"name": "audio_transcript", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "retrievable": true},
    {"name": "speaker_attribution", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "retrievable": true},
    {"name": "conversation_topics", "type": "Edm.String", "searchable": true, "retrievable": true}
]

```

This unified index becomes the foundation for intelligent retrieval operations, enabling semantically rich search experiences that leverage the full context and relationships within your enterprise content ecosystem

### 3. Utilize Azure OpenAI Models

Once your content is extracted and indexed, integrate [Azure OpenAI's embedding and chat models](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions) to create an interactive question-answering system:

1. **Retrieve relevant content** from your unified index when a user submits a query
2. **Create an effective prompt** that combines the user's question with the retrieved context
3. **Generate responses** using Azure OpenAI models that reference specific content from various modalities

This approach grounds responses with your actual content, enabling the model to answer questions by referencing specific document sections, describing relevant images, quoting from video transcripts, or citing speaker statements from audio recordings.

The combination of Content Understanding's extraction capabilities, Azure AI Search's retrieval functions, and Azure OpenAI's generation abilities creates a powerful end-to-end RAG solution that can seamlessly work with all your content types.
