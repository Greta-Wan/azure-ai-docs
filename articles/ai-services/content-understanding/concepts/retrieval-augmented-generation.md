# Retrieval Augmented Generation with Content Understanding

# Introduction
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a design pattern that enhances the quality of responses generated by large language models (LLMs) by using external sources of knowledge to supplement the LLM's internal representation of information. This approach allows LLMs to access the most up-to-date and reliable facts from a knowledge base or internal information storage. 

Azure AI Content Understanding employs Generative AI to convert unstructured documents, images, videos, and audio into structured data, which is vital for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Structured outputs ensure efficient, accurate retrieval of relevant information, leading to high-quality, contextually appropriate responses. Additionally, Content Understanding includes confidence scores and grounding to improve the reliability and credibility of the information, resulting in more coherent outputs.

## Semantic Chunking with Content Understanding
Semantic chunking breaks down content into meaningful segments, crucial for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. This technique allows precise, efficient information retrieval by leveraging contextual data, ultimately enhancing the accuracy and coherence of generated responses. By structuring documents according to logical boundaries like sections and paragraphs, semantic chunking organizes large data volumes into manageable pieces, accelerating the retrieval process while ensuring relevance and reliability.

Azure AI Content Understanding is meticulously designed to support Retrieval-Augmented Generation use cases, offering robust capabilities for processing and understanding diverse content types. With Markdown output available for documents, audio, and video, users can seamlessly integrate structured and readable content into their workflows. 
* For document content, Azure AI Content Understanding provides structured document segments to align with contextual breaks like sections, paragraphs, or tables. You can use the Markdown content from Layout model to split documents based on paragraph boundaries, create specific chunks for tables, and fine-tune your chunking strategy to improve the quality of the generated responses.
* For audio content, Azure AI Content Understanding provides advanced transcription services, diarisation, and speaker role detection, enabling precise identification and segmentation of spoken content. This allows for the extraction of meaningful audio segments, facilitating effective semantic chunking. 
* For video content, Azure AI Content Understanding offers scene summaries, key frame extraction, and shot detection, which helps in breaking down video data into coherent and contextually relevant segments.
Azure AI Content Understanding excels in supporting Retrieval-Augmented Generation applications, effectively structuring documents, audio, and video into relevant segments. This enhances data reliability and retrieval efficiency, making it a valuable tool for real-time data analysis.

The image below illustrates the page elements and content that Content Understanding extracts from documents with Layout analysis, showcasing Content Understandingâ€™s capability to provide a structured representation of extracted regions of interest and their inter-relationships.

## Building a RAG Solution and Chat with Content Understanding
**Data Extraction with Azure Content Understanding:** Azure AI Content Understanding efficiently converts unstructured documents, images, videos, and audio into structured data formats. Documents are transformed into structured data, distinguishing between tables, paragraphs, sections, and figures. Audio is transcribed with precise timestamps and speaker labels, while video content is transcribed, summarized with key frames, descriptions, and relevant metadata. 
* For more information follow our [**API**](../quickstart/use-rest-api.md) and [**Studio**](../quickstart/use-ai-foundry.md) Quickstart guide to learn how to extract structured output from input files and create a custom analyzer. Follow our [**code samples**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ai-content-understanding-python) for simple demos on extracting data from multimodal files.

**Indexing with Azure AI Search and Querying with Azure OpenAI Service:** Once data is structured, [**Azure AI Search**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/search-get-started-portal) can create a comprehensive, searchable index and [**Azure OpenAI's**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/concepts/models?tabs=global-standard%2Cstandard-chat-completions) chat models can efficiently query and search through indexed content, providing accurate and contextually relevant answers. 
* For more information, see our [**code samples**](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-ai-search-with-content-understanding-python#samples) demonstrating RAG pattern with Azure AI Content Understanding for structured data extraction, Azure Search for indexing and retrieval and querying data with OpenAI chat models.
